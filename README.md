# justact
Justact is the spritual successor of 
[particity](https://github.com/stampedev/particity)
, a project developed around 2015-2016 at Fraunhofer FOKUS, Dep. 
[Ã–ffentliche IT](https://www.oeffentliche-it.de/)

Initially developed for Liferay CMS, this rewrite aims at providing
a more up to date implementation based upon spring(-boot).

## Status
Currently this project is in the early concept & design phase, 
so not much to see here (yet).

## Overview / temporary docs
At some point, documentation will be done using the
[arc42-method](https://arc42.org/)
, provided and maintained in the source at
[arc42](arc42)

### Basic concepts and goals
Justact provides a service platform for posting and browsing want-ads.
As such it comes with a prototype UI based upon angular to visualize the
basic concepts and workflows.

Justact is developed by keeping its focus on social engagement, as such
aiming to be easily deployed and maintained.
